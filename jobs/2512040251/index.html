I don’t have the ability to browse external websites in real time, so I can’t perform live searches on SEEK, Indeed, LinkedIn or the other platforms, and I can’t retrieve or verify current job ads, URLs, posting dates, or descriptions. Because of your data‑integrity requirement, I also can’t invent job listings or guess details.

Given those constraints, I can still do the following reliably:

1. **Task 1 – Skills Inventory (from your Work History)**  
   Here is a condensed skills inventory extracted from the document, ready for later matching:

   - **3D Modelling & Real‑Time Engines**
     - 3DS Max (20+ years), ZBrush, SketchUp, CAT rigging
     - Unreal Engine development, Unity (including VR / Meta Quest)
     - Game object development, interactive objects, shader development
   - **Materials, Texturing & Rendering**
     - Substance Painter, Substance Designer, PBR material workflows
     - Octane Render, V‑Ray, (listed) Corona, environment lighting
   - **VFX, Simulation & Procedural**
     - Embergen (fluid dynamics), TYFlow, Particle Flow
     - Railclone, Forest Pack Pro, SpeedTree
   - **VR / XR, Visualisation & Photogrammetry**
     - VR experiences (Unity, Meta Quest), architectural visualisation
     - Matterport scanning, Reality Capture photogrammetry
     - Scan‑to‑low‑poly optimisation for VR
   - **Video, Motion & Multimedia**
     - Adobe After Effects, Premiere, Davinci Resolve
     - Video editing, compositing, post‑grading
     - Adobe Animate, VN, Canva
   - **Imaging, Graphics & Web**
     - Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, XD
     - Logo/SVG/icon design, signage and decals
     - HTML/CSS/JavaScript (basic), PHP/CSS web development
   - **Programming, Automation & Data**
     - Python scripting/automation, MaxScript
     - Advanced Excel/Google Sheets logic and tools
     - JSON handling, API integration (websites, spreadsheets, media APIs)
   - **AI, Generative & Automation Platforms**
     - ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Leonardo.ai
     - RunwayML, Lumai, ElevenLabs
     - Make.com workflow automation scenarios and integrations
     - Hugging Face, Google Colab, PyTorch, PrivateGPT setups
   - **Project / Soft Skills**
     - Project management, team leadership, quoting, client liaison
     - Storyboarding, script outline, planning
     - Photography (including panoramic and graded escort photography)

2. **What I can’t do from here (and why)**  
   - I cannot:
     - Search Seek/Indeed/LinkedIn/ArtStation etc in real time.
     - Confirm whether any role exists in “Perth, WA” in the last 14 days.
     - Extract canonical URLs, posting dates, company names, or descriptions.
   - If I fabricated “sample” jobs, that would violate your requirement to never hallucinate or infer job data.

3. **How we can still reach an HTML output workflow you can use**

If you can supply one of the following, I can complete Tasks 3–5 exactly as requested:

- **Option A:** Paste 3–10 current job ads (from any of the listed sites) that:
  - Are in Perth, WA
  - Correspond to any of your “Job Roles”
  - Include the job title, company name, location, posting date, full description, and the direct job URL (you can copy from your browser)
- **Option B:** Provide an exported CSV or JSON snippet of job results you obtained via another tool, including:
  - Title, company, location, date, URL, description, skills/requirements if already parsed

Given that data, I will:

1. **Task 3 – Radar data per job**  
   - Identify 5–8 key skill categories from each job description (aligned to categories like 3D Modelling, Real‑Time Engine, Programming, Texturing, Video, AI/Automation, Project Management, Web, etc).
   - Score:
     - **Candidate score (0–10):** based solely on your documented skills.
     - **Job requirement intensity (0–10):** based strictly on wording in the ad.
   - Prepare a JS‑ready structure for Chart.js radar charts for each job.

2. **Task 4 – Job summaries**  
   For each job you provide:
   - 2–3 sentence factual summary
   - Key responsibilities and required skills
   - Short statement on relevance to your background (no exaggeration; only from documented skills and the job text)

3. **Task 5 – Full HTML (two‑column layout with charts)**  
   - Insert a `<div class="job-card">` per job with:
     - Title, company, location, posting date, source, URL, any contact found
     - 2–3 sentence summary
     - Bullet list of main requirements
   - Include a `<canvas>` element and a per‑job `<script>` block initialising a Chart.js radar chart using the Task 3 scores.
   - Fill the metadata sidebar with:
     - Count of jobs by source site
     - Note for any source that had “no results provided” (based on what you send)
     - Timestamp / filters (Perth, last 14 days – as per your constraints)

If you’d like, you can start by pasting just 2–3 Perth job ads (including their direct URLs), and I’ll produce a complete minimal HTML file implementing your template and radar charts for those, which you can then scale up by reusing the pattern.
